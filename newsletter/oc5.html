        <p>Welcome to the roaring twenties. Time moves ever onwards. I hope your holiday was full of that which brings you the most joy: family, solitude, a good book, puppies, sports, whatever, and I hope you begin this new year with intention and a sense of what&#39;s possible in a year that cannot be accomplished in a day.</p>
        <p>We left our co-working space and have taken up residence in a food hall/coffee shop because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality">indoor air quality</a> issues. We found that CO2 levels in our little office regularly exceeded 3,000 PPM. It only occurred to us to measure this after noting how lethargic we frequently felt in this room, vs how productive we were whenever working out of a coffee shop nearby. Set and setting: Not just for acid trips.</p>
        <p>This newsletter has grown a bit. What began as a small collection of friends has expanded to include a wonderful group of curious, thoughtful humans. I&#39;ll be moving more detailed Sublime updates elsewhere, and occasionally mention major stuff here. Look for these occasional updates in <em>Other random stuff</em>.</p>

        <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Mis√©rables</a></em> by Victor Hugo. I suspect this will take a great while to finish. At first, I thought I must be reading the wrong book. Instead of <em>Les Mis</em>, I&#39;d picked up a biography of a rustic French bishop. I was right and wrong.</p>
        <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musashi_(novel">Musashi</a>)</em> by Eiji Yoshikawa. I&#39;ve just finished this today. The heroes and villains that populate this Japanese epic are so very different from those found in American and European equivalents. This was one of the greatest works I&#39;ve fiction I&#39;ve read, and I daresay if it wasn&#39;t so long it would be a staple of undergraduate literature courses. I&#39;m saddened that my experience of reading this book is over, and thankful for the questions it created in my mind.</p>
