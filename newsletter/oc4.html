        <h1 id="-outside-context-4-human-connection-">Outside Context 4: Human Connection</h1>
        <p>I sent the last newsletter out at the end of September, and the intervening six+ weeks have been a whirlwind. At times full of quiet, dogged determination, as Josh and I holed up in our tiny co-working space and grind, and at times loud and full of human interaction. We&#39;re nearly ready to ship our first iteration of the new Sublime product. The core engine is built, and it works! We&#39;re now able to write a new detection in seconds and run it instantly. That&#39;s pretty cool. We&#39;ll ship this to a first cohort of 10 early access users and we can&#39;t wait to see what they do with it.</p>
        <p><strong>Here&#39;s some of what we were up to these past six weeks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipped a first draft of our docs to some early access customers and got a lot of great feedback that we&#39;ve since incorporated.</li>
            <li>Attended our first ever <a href="https://twitter.com/nysecsec">NYSEC</a> meetup. Highly recommended for NYC area security folks. It&#39;s very informal and the people are incredibly welcoming. There&#39;s a good mix of industry veterans and total newbies.</li>
            <li>Attended <a href="https://www.zerodaycon.com/">Zero Day Con</a> and had a number of solid investor meetings in DC. We also caught a day of <a href="http://www.bsidesdc.org/">BSidesDC</a> while in town.</li>
            <li>I became a godfather!</li>
            <li>We met with three Fortune 500 companies that were incredibly excited to get their hands on Sublime. We&#39;re so fortunate to be working on something that people want. I hope to start sharing more of this feedback publicly soon, probably via Twitter.</li>
            <li>Interviewed at YC and didn&#39;t get in. We did a fair number of opportunistic investor meetings in SF as well. Very thankful for these, and we&#39;ve learned a lot along the way.</li>
            <li>Attended <a href="https://la19.summit.co/">Summit LA&#39;19</a>, my first Summit experience. By far the best session was <a href="https://themagic.love/">&quot;The Magic of Human Connection&quot; by Jessica Encell Coleman</a>. I got to hear incredible speakers and meet truly remarkable humans. My overall feeling about the event: gratitude.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, we&#39;re settled back in Brooklyn, which mostly means we get to work with a monitor again vs just a laptop screen. Pretty big deal. Also it&#39;s extremely cold here.</p>
        <p>I hope this newsletter inspires and challenges you. Cheers.</p>
        <p><strong>What I&#39;m reading</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Mis√©rables</a></em> by Victor Hugo. I left <em>Musashi</em> at home on a recent few weeks of travel, and found myself without anything to read! So after many years of procrastination, I&#39;ve finally picked up <em>Les Mis.</em> Reading this via the Kindle app on my phone.</li>
            <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musashi_(novel">Musashi</a>)</em> by Eiji Yoshikawa. Hard to overstate how much I&#39;m enjoying this. It&#39;s also refreshing to read a physical book.</li>
            <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness">Fooled by Randomness</a></em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>. I&#39;ll read anything Taleb writes. Ingesting this one via Audible, mostly while running or in the gym.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">&quot;What nobody tells you about documentation&quot;</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/evildmp">Daniele Procida</a>. We&#39;re about to ship something pretty exciting at Sublime, and it entails releasing documentation for the first time. Neither of us know much about documentation, so Josh and I spent some time learning how to do this really well. This was the best treatise on the subject that we found. Recommended reading for any founder, PM, or marketer working with docs.</li>
            <li><a href="https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1/public-yess-and-private-no-s-6c6d376f1280">&quot;Public Yes&#39;s, Private No&#39;s&quot;</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/mallyvai">Vaibhav Mallya</a>. A small way to make your net impact on reality more positive.</li>
            <li>Class and inequality of opportunity collide in this <a href="https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/department/studentaffairs/document/markovitscommencementrev.pdf">Yale Law commencement address</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://twitter.com/stewartbrand">Stewart Brand</a> writes (in 1990) about <a href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/Earthquake_Lessons.html">his experience</a> in the immediate aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Lessons in authority, community, and human connection.</li>

        <p><strong>What I&#39;m listening to</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/09Rd5hfBdtOBIhLaRvm96M?highlight=spotify:track:4V0rrbFdfzLbcV3WOYjXXa">The Quiet Earth</a> by Thomas Barrandon. This entire album is absolutely incredible. Sort of synthwave, sort of outer space.</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6udA6tzAZ2bolSfaSibQEV?si=Sbs1gOTXRq2tAwA_M_AbPQ">Pay Phone</a> by Fantom &#39;87. Also synthwave + outer space. Something you&#39;d listen to at a sunrise set at Burning Man: Mars.</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FyDu4RcmgVNEKXxt9eB8I?si=45sr85SyRY-7aoFkGxAydQ">Another Try</a> by Dan Edmonds. Smooth and cozy indie.</li>

SpaceX launches are particularly well-produced and fun to watch, in part because the booster rockets come back to earth and land.</li>
            <li><strong>Founders</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here&#39;s an incredibly helpful <a href="https://smartasset.com/infographic/startup">calculator for dilution and returns</a>. I can only imagine how many founders have tried to build one of these in a spreadsheet.</li>
                    <li>Sign the pledge and <a href="https://www.electionday.org/">make election days a paid company holiday for your employees</a>.</li>
