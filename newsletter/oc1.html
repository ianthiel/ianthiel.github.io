        <h1 id="outside-context-1-beginnings">Outside Context 1: Beginnings</h1>
        <p>Welcome to a newsletter of random things that fall out of my brain: Outside Context. Sci Fi fans might recognize the name from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem">Iain M. Banks’ Culture novels</a>. Beginnings are important, and if I can imbue this series of writings with some purpose here at the outset it would be: To bring us closer together as friends, colleagues, and humans while we navigate the shared experiences of work and life. As individuals and as a species we are regularly encountering outside context problems, and how we deal with these problems will determine our individual and collective futures.Here follows my small contribution to that effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Sublime updates</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>My co-founder Josh and I are currently bouncing back and forth between San Francisco and DC while working on <a href="https://sublimesecurity.com/">Sublime Security</a>. We’re focused on customer development and using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507">The Four Steps to The Epiphany</a> as our guide.</li>
            <li>We&#39;re actively researching and considering where to establish our HQ. Leading contenders right now are NYC, DC, and SF. We&#39;re currently seeking more information about hiring eng and design in DC, and about hiring security talent in NYC. If that&#39;s something you or someone you know has experience with, please let us know!</li>
            <li>We publicly released an API that we built for our own consumption: <a href="https://emailrep.io/">emailrep.io</a>. We&#39;ve been fortunate enough to have this picked up by some security podcasts: <a href="https://osintcurio.us/webcast-20190106-1/">We are OSINTCurio.us</a> and <a href="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/2019/05/03/the-privacy-security-osint-show-episode-121/">IntelTechniques</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What I’m currently reading</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Energy and Civilization: A History</em> by Vaclav Smil (analog). Bill Gates says he reads anything Vaclav Smil writes. I’m interested in primers on fundamentals of our existence as humans, and so far this book fits the bill. For a more detailed review, you can <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Energy-and-Civilization">see what Bill Gates has to say</a>.</li>
            <li><em>Thinking in Bets</em> by Annie Duke (Audible). Annie is a badass professional poker player and decision maker. She presents an analysis of how successful poker players make decisions and applications of these techniques beyond the game itself. Playfully written and narrated by the author.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/smarter-living/the-right-way-to-ask-can-i-pick-your-brain.html">&quot;The Right Way to Ask, ‘Can I Pick Your Brain?’&quot;</a> by Anna Goldfarb @ The New York Times. A helpful addendum to <em>The Four Steps</em> as I’ve been doing a lot of this the past few weeks.</li>
            <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/if-you-re-playing-eve-online-you-basically-already-have-1835048929">&quot;If You&#39;re Playing <em>EVE Online</em> You Basically Already Have An MBA&quot;</a> by Lee Yancy @ Kotaku. I played an awful lot of <em>EVE Online</em> while in high school and undergrad. It was one of the most formative experiences of my young life and this article brought back a lot of very fond memories.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-get-from-san-franc_n_6432894">&quot;How to Get From San Francisco to Yosemite, Guilt-Free -- on Public Transit&quot;</a> by Kristan Lawson @ HuffPost. Ashamed to say that after living in San Francisco for nearly 7 years, I didn&#39;t know this. You can take public transit from SF to Yosemite without too much fuss, and at just an hour slower than driving yourself. Wow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Awesome humans</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://twitter.com/linamelia">Amelia Lin</a> is working on <a href="https://keeplifestories.com/">Keep Life Stories</a>. I recently bought a few hours for my mom to use with her mom, and the result was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-marx/">Gary Marx</a> is working on <a href="https://www.pacificcoastwaters.com/">Pacific Coast Waters</a>.

            <li><a href="https://twitter.com/austen">Austen Allred</a> is working on <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a>. It&#39;s a 9 month coding bootcamp that&#39;s free until you get a job. Everyone will be talking about this soon enough. If this existed when I was in my early 20s, I absolutely would have gone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Here&#39;s an amazing video showing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=300673160533598">transits of Jupiter moons Io and Europa</a>. These images were taken by Juno, a probe we have currently orbiting Jupiter.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, <a href="http://particlefever.com/">Particle Fever</a> chronicles the creation and activation of the Large Hadron Collider, and is one of my absolute favorite documentaries.</li>

            <li>Have you ever thought &quot;Wow, Ian sure talks about drinking water a lot. Is there a subreddit for people like him where they post memes about drinking water?&quot; The answer is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hydrohomies">yes, yes there is</a>.</li>
            <li>All of my house plants have died except my peace lily. If you have recommendations for other immortal house plants, let me know.</li>
            <li>I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro_Khanna">Ro Khanna</a> at <a href="https://www.itsjane.com/">Jane on Fillmore</a> but didn&#39;t get a chance to say hi because he was on the phone.</li>
            <li>I&#39;ll be in NYC June 8-11, Haiti June 12-17, and DC June 18-25. If our spacetime coordinates will converge, let me know!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Always interested in hearing what you think, ideas for stuff I might include in the future, and items you&#39;d like to see more of.</p>
