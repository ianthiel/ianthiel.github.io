<p>Much of the world is now either mentally or physically in the grips of COVID-19. If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, or think this whole thing is overblown, you can get up to speed quickly <a href="https://staythefuckhome.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently safe and healthy in Brooklyn, spending an awful lot of time in my room. When I&#39;m not working, reading, or listening to music, I go out for a walk or a long run to Prospect Park or the East River. I have 3 masks left and wear one whenever I go outside. I wash my hands constantly, and try to keep 2 weeks of food stocked in my kitchen.</p>
<p>We&#39;re at a critical juncture with Sublime, and dividing our time between on-boarding new users (we recently shipped support for Office 365), and shipping feature requests for those users. We&#39;re starting to think about hiring and have posted some basics on <a href="https://angel.co/company/sublime-security/jobs">AngelList</a>. Fundraising is also in our near future, although we continue to have 6+ months of runway.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re at home under lockdown, social distancing, or just WFH, I hope this email gives you some positive things to read. I suspect we could all use a break from stress-reading Twitter and watching the news.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/books/review/freeman-dyson-maker-of-patterns.html">Maker of Patterns</a> by Freeman Dyson. I&#39;m back to reading Freeman&#39;s autobiographical collection of letters. I&#39;m finding their brevity and wit a comfort in these trying times. He possessed a clarity of thought coupled with simple yet rich language that goes down like a bowl of warm soup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X">The Book of Why</a> by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie. I won&#39;t pretend that I&#39;m fully understanding this book, but what I&#39;ve gathered thus far is fascinating. Pearl and Mackenzie posit that our scientific toolkit lacks a mathematical grammar for expressing causal relationships. In this book, they lay out why this is a problem, and propose to solve it with a novel diagram.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Program-Graphic-Design/dp/1941753213">A New Program for Graphic Design</a> by David Reinfurt. I find myself doing a surprising amount of design, or at least design-thinking. I&#39;ve never read a single book on graphic design, any kind of design, so I&#39;m starting with this one. If you have recommendations, please send them my way.</p>
<p>An historic $2T bailout package looks likely to be enacted by congress. Here&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/corporate-socialism-the-government-is-bailing-out-investors-managers-not-you-3b31a67bff4a">a cogent critique from Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>, and <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/experts/open-letter-to-congress-regarding-coronavirus-stimulus-package">another from a set of MIT Sloan professors</a>.</p>
<p>Streaming is exploding. Sure Netflix et al are getting more popular than they already were, but the really interesting stuff is happening on platforms like Twitch, where there&#39;s way less of a content middleman. Check out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21151223/twitch-dr-disrespect-streaming-contract-personality-mixer-kobe-bryant">this feature of one of the world&#39;s top streamers</a> to get a feel for the incredible creativity on offer.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve organized most of the songs below in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/27jrJ03dohUnC3pQshVVz2?si=4HfZ5dvrREWKFFFeEV1WvQ">this Spotify playlist</a>, for our mutual enjoyment. I&#39;ll include one of these with every newsletter, because music is an important element of my existence. I won&#39;t necessarily talk about all the songs on the playlist in this section, because I don&#39;t always have something meaningful to say about all of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0PPExiBBXrtzWjsT3BLofh?si=CHo2FFwrSiCVUy5IZQEUyA">&quot;Son &amp; Daughter&quot;</a> by Queen. My favorite track from Queen&#39;s first album. This is before they developed their own unique sound, but it&#39;s a damn good representation of the best that 1973 had to offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3A1kkAIXl4IPxeJRCCF4Bc?si=V4ToreeIQl6fBBnJvQ5Wxw">&quot;Touch&quot;</a> by Cigarettes After Sex. Achingly beautiful, great for leaning into the feeling of crushing loneliness brought on by social distancing.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1KjBsubnUzAU1dvxIEUky4?si=Dzi_mQcpQsWgI2mRkQz28g">&quot;A Glowing Light, a Promise&quot;</a> by Makeup And Vanity Set. This entire 2012 album, <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2j4ro7dtXWPrSjjE7mdKqY?si=Z5X_DOimSCa3pIVNmI66jQ">88:88</a></em>, is really fucking good. Other favorites: &quot;Homecoming&quot;, &quot;System Override&quot;</p>
