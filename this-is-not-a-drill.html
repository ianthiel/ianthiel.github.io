      This is not a drill.

      This is the one run-through that will really matter.
      All your training, your education, your experience, has been for this.

      Are you ready?

      You wonder if all the books and articles you've read are
      enough to prepare you for this ultimate test we call the present moment.
      Perhaps you should have learned an instrument as a child, or a second
      language. Maybe you spent too much time playing video games, or laughing
      at memes. Perhaps you should have studied harder, and longer.

      Are you ready?

      There are no klaxons, no ringing, no blinking red lights. No one is
      yelling. There's no stampede. One day is much like the other, and the
      endless landscape of human experience blends together so readily, so
      easily, as to overwhelm your ability to pick out the details. Data
      compression of reality. A 4k world in 480p.

      Are you ready?

      This is it. It's coming right now, it's always coming, and it will always
      be coming long after you've gone. The moment rolls on, over and through
      us. Endlessly. There is never any time to prepare. There is no training.
      It's here.

      This is not a drill.
